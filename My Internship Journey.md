Watashi no Intānshippu Monogatari (私のインターンシップ物語). I'm grateful for getting the opportunity to start this internship at FULLSPEED TECHNOLOGIES INC. I always considered myself an average student, so landing an internship was something I didn't expect. However, my enthusiasm for learning played a crucial role. The interview, which I thought was just a routine step, turned out to be with the vice department manager, who later became my mentor. It was a surprise and a turning point for me.

## Diving into the Unknown

Starting this internship 24 weeks back, I was the only intern at first, but I knew more would come later. The tech stuff I had to work on included programming languages I didn't know, but I took it on as a challenge. I strongly believe that what matters most is the person using the technology, not just the tech itself. This time became the start of a big learning journey for me. I had to get used to new things, but I was ready to learn and grow.

## Warm Welcomes and Surprises

In the initial days of my internship, the atmosphere was really pleasant and inviting. My mentor made an extra effort, treating me to a welcome lunch, and the company even provided me with a MacBook, which was pretty awesome. This is not something every IT intern gets, so I felt fortunate. Even though it was early in my internship, it was clear that the company genuinely cares about its employees. This unexpected act of kindness helped me ease into the professional environment smoothly. Feeling valued right from the start, I was motivated and ready to give my best to the company.

## Building Bonds Beyond the Internship

Getting to know other interns from various schools was a fantastic part of my internship. Even though we didn't begin at the same time, we swiftly connected, becoming close friends by sharing our common interest in tech. It was surprising how our diverse backgrounds didn't keep us apart; instead, we formed a strong unity. Beginning as colleagues, we developed lasting connections that extended beyond our internship responsibilities.

## Collaborative Learning Environment

Collaborating with fellow interns was a big plus during my internship. They knew the technologies we were using, which was different from my situation where I didn't have much prior knowledge. Their willingness to help out made it easier for me to catch up and learn. This teamwork not only made facing challenges more fun but also improved the learning process overall. The collaborative spirit among us made the whole internship experience more supportive and enjoyable.

## Unconventional Team Building

Monthly team-building activities were a highlight during my internship. They were not the typical resort getaways I expected. Instead, we did various things like going out for meals and trying bouldering. This unique approach brought a refreshing and enjoyable twist to our daily work routine, making it stand out.

Engaging in activities like dining out allowed us to bond in a relaxed setting, share stories and get to know each other better. Bouldering, a different and exciting team-building choice, added an element of adventure to our experiences. These activities not only made work more enjoyable but also strengthened the camaraderie within the team.

## A Pressure-Free Learning Space

One great thing about this internship was how chill it was, which is not common for most students. There wasn't too much stress, so we had lots of time to learn and practice our skills. The resources and help we got were super important for us to get better. This relaxed environment not only helped us learn but also made us think creatively and solve problems easily.

In this laid-back setting, we could explore and improve our skills without feeling too much pressure. Learning without stress was cool and made it easy for us to come up with creative ideas and solve problems. It was a nice way to work that not only made the internship fun but also helped us grow a lot.

## The Mentorship Impact

One remarkable aspect of my internship experience was the guidance and mentorship provided by my mentor. He is an experienced professional with expertise that goes beyond just IT. His knowledge and insights were not limited to technical skills but extended to a broader understanding of the professional world.

My mentor played a crucial role in shaping my understanding of the industry. He didn't only focus on teaching technical skills but also emphasized the importance of professionalism. I learned how to approach tasks with a sense of responsibility, how to communicate effectively in a professional setting, and the significance of teamwork. Under his mentorship, I gained valuable insights into the concept of continuous learning. He instilled in me the idea that in the ever-evolving field of technology, it's essential to stay curious and keep acquiring new knowledge. This perspective has not only influenced my approach to work but has also become a guiding principle in my ongoing journey as a learner and a professional.

## Shaping a Better Future

Looking back on this internship, I am truly thankful for the valuable experience it provided. It has given me essential skills and insights that will be crucial for my career. I'm eager to give my best to FULLSPEED TECHNOLOGIES INC., and I'm excited about the opportunity to work with dedication and gratitude. This internship has played a significant role in shaping my future and boosting my confidence in my abilities.
